# hr_Analytics_dashboard

Overview: 
-Designed and implemented a Power BI dashboard to effectively monitor and analyze employee attrition rates. 
-The implementation of the dashboard resulted in streamlined HR processes, significantly enhancing operational efficiency.

Problem Statement:
-We have employee data for a company named Atliq. Data is in an Excel file, of three months in different sheets.
-To understand the working preference of the employee between WFH and WFO.
-They are taking frequent WFH, either Monday or Friday then what could be the reason behind that?
-And also find the Employee Presence %, WFH %, SL(Sick Leave) % according to the date.

Solution Steps:
1. Now, we upload that employee data which is in an Excel file into Power BI.
2. And after transform data, a new window opens called Power Query Editor(also called the Data Engineering side of Power BI).
3. In this Editor, where we transform data and clean the data, basically we do Data Preparation which gives meaningful insights.
4. We also create a template that is correct by date in a row and apply it on those sheets and also for the upcoming month's sheets.
5. In the process of transform the data, we also use to transpose the row. In Power Query, we have the same thing through a option or tab called "Unpivot Column".
6. After creating that template make a function of that template and make new parameters.
7. Apply these parameters to our main dataset to make it simple and clean.
8. Creating Metrics Using DAX and we also use DAX to create additional column.
9. After find all the measures as per our Problem Statement, we jump into the Dashboarding.
10. And make meaningful and data-driven insights through visualization. You can go through my Power BI file.
